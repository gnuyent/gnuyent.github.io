# About

Hi! My name is Brandon.

I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/). Currently, I am interested in computer security and systems programming with Python and Rust.

This summer, I will be interning at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/).
