Over the past few months, I've had the great opportunity to intern at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) doing full-stack development on the Electronic Filing Engine (EFE) team. Between coffee chats, zoom standups, and tedious fights with IntelliJ, here's a list of tips for success.

## Learn your tools

Learn how to effectively use your editor. If you don't know which editor to use, go with the one most of your coworkers use. Learn how to debug well (e.g. breakpoints, dropping frames) and trace your code (e.g. hot paths, call stacks). Customize your hotkeys and use them. Google (DuckDuckGo?). A lot.

`git` is a powerful version control system where many people only know the (un)holy *add, commit, push* cycle. Break past this and take the time to flesh out your understanding. Some of my most used git sub-commands were [`add`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add), [`commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), [`push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push), [`checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout), [`stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash), [`cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick), [`status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status), [`log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log), and [`rebase`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).

## Be patient, be frustrated

You'll face a lot of issues with your code.

* Take your time to read compiler and runtime errors.
* Read through stack traces and analyze your code (use a debugger!).
* Check unit/integration tests to see how your code should operate and how other people have done it in the past.
* Web search your problem.
* Write out your problem with pen and paper.
* Take a short break.

If you haven't solved your problem after a couple of hours, reach out to your mentor and ask for help.

Seriously, use your debugger.

## Use dumb questions for success

Dumb questions are king. When you're working with a new technology/framework/library/language/something else, you'll inevitably face something that *should* work but doesn't. A lot of these questions could be answered by a web search or some deep analysis of the codebase. When in doubt, ask your mentor - don't waste your time on a simple problem.

One caveat: make sure you understand their answer (ask for clarification!). Rule of thumb: only one dumb question per topic.

## Don't write magic (usually)

Write code that you can understand after a week-long break (Intuit gave us a full recharge week!). Use good, understandable variable names. Opt for simpler code, even if it is a little longer (for loops over crazy comprehensions? yes!). If you *have* to write magic, document it well.

## Get to know your people

Setup meetings with your fellow interns - grab lunch or get a coffee together. Take some time to meet your non-intern team. Learn about what they do and how they individually contribute to whatever you're doing. Be comfortable sharing your opinions and ideas. More importantly, don't be afraid to be wrong.

During my internship, I met regularly with my mentors and managers, as well as other interns. It was a great way to check-up on my progress, ask simple questions without bothering someone all the time, and get to know them. I learned a little bit about each person's job and got to explore different subsets of tech with them.

Also, pair programming? Awesome.

## Setting good goals

Something, something [SMART](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) goals. This one is funny to me since I wrote terrible goals initially and slowly embraced making good goals as I progressed. Make goals that you want to achieve. Ask your mentors/managers/co-workers for help to achieve them.

## Stay healthy

You're going to be spending a lot of time (and brainpower) at a computer solving problems. Take as much time as you can away from a screen. Go on a walk during your lunch break. Meet up with other people. Exercise a lot. Sleep regularly and well. Drink a lot of water. Stand up often.

## Closing

Here's some last-minute thoughts:

* Software engineering is all about communication. Everything else can be learned on the job.
* Don't worry too much about getting a return offer.
* Enjoy the ride and learn new things every day.

Interning at Intuit was honestly one of the most fulfilling experiences of my (short) professional career. If you liked this post and want to talk to me more, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brandonnguyen02) or shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:gnuyent@protonmail.com).
